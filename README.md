# Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my personal website. It is built using [SvelteKit][svelte-kit] and [Flowbite Svelte][flowbite-svelte]. I am using [GitHub Pages][github-pages] to host it.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`,
start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
````

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
